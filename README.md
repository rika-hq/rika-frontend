# Rika Frontend

This repository contains SPA React codebase of Rika project.

## Build

You can build a Docker image for the frontend. To do this, just type the command below in your command prompt:

```shell
yarn build:container
```

This command deletes the previous image (if it exists) and builds a new one named rika-frontend.
